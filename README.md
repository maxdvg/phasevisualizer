Phasevisualizer is music visualization software inspired by composer [Scriabin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Scriabin) purported synesthesia.

Production in Python is currently frozen, with plans to migrate existing functionality to Haskell and add additional functionality thereafter. The migration to Haskell will be accompanied with more extensive documentation.
